## Inline Math

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$.

## Block Math

The integral of x squared:

$$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}$$

A summation:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## Mixed Content

When we have $f(x) = x^2$, the derivative is:

$$f'(x) = 2x$$

And the second derivative is $f''(x) = 2$.

## Special Cases

- Dollar signs in text should work: The price is $50.
- Empty dollar signs $$ should be handled.
- Math with subscripts: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.
