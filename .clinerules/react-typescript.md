## React/TypeScript Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or styled-components for component-level styling
- **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) with Context API for global state
- **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and modern tooling)
- **Package Manager:** npm (following Node 22 requirement)
- **Formatting and Linting:** Prettier and ESLint for consistent style and code quality
- **Testing Guidelines:**
    - Tests should be written using Jest with React Testing Library.
    - Component tests should validate rendering, user interactions, and state changes.
    - Integration tests should cover significant interactions between components and global state.
